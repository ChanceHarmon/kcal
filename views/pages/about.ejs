        <p>This project is important to me because I am someone who struggles 
          with weight management, this has helped lay out everything I need 
          in order to be sucessful with managing my eating habits. I can see 
          a projected goal date which keeps me motivated and I can also save 
          my favorite meals! </p>

        <p>This project was a fantastic experience as a group. It has been a 
          great opportuinty to work all of the muscles we have been building. 
          All of the downfalls will or have turned into future successes. As 
          an avid seaker of life hacks, I think we did a solid job at contributing 
          to the health conscious community.</p>
