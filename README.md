Conflict Plan

Disagreements – When we disagree, we will do the following:
-    Bring it up, and actually discuss pros and cons
-    Listen to one another, make sure to value different opinions
-    Vote on options and move on

Complaints –
-    If there is a complaint, bring it up with a solution already in mind

Communication –
-    We will commit to communicate before we do anything on slack or text so that no issues arise
-    We will be kind to one another and respect each other’s differences

Communication
We will communicate over slack and possibly over text if that works best, we will have set hours.
Every person has air time and we verbally check to make sure we all are onboard.
We are responsible adults and are respectful of another, we have experienced unsafe environments so we are committed to not let that happen again.
